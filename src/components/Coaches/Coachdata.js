        level: "Crossfit Level 1",
        bio: "Andrey has learned what does and does not work when it comes to health and fitness through years of first-hand experience.  His fitness journey was not always easy, experiencing highs like taking 1st place in his debut physique show at the age of 23, and lows like trying diets and workouts which yielded little to no results.  This is why he is a eager to share his outlook with others, so they can avoid mistakes he made early on, and focus on what actually works. Ultimately his goal is to make sure every client or member gets the results they are looking for and to provide a life changing experience at Fully Tapped Fitness.  In addition, to his personal experience Andrey was influenced by a trainer in Florida for whom he worked as an intern / coach for two years.  The trainer supplied invaluable lessons and motivated Andrey to own a gym with his brother as a way to change lives.",

        name:"Roman Makhadov",
        level: "Crossfit Level 1",
        bio: "Roman initially got into fitness and working out because of his older brother Andrey.  Andrey would jokingly say Roman would be a “stick man” for life if he didn’t hit the gym.  Despite being a little insulted, he got up, and hit the gym daily.  Over the years his passion for working out for himself turned to wanting to help others reach their goals, grow their confidence, and make them healthier both inside and out. He is a perpetual student of health and fitness, believing he can always gain more knowledge to share with his clients and members.  Therefore he is constantly updating certifications, reading books, and continuing his education by taking collegiate courses in Exercise Science.  He loves coming to work each day knowing he has the opportunity to inspire and motivate people to accomplish things that were once outside their comfort zone.",
